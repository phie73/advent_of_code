# 2022

trying to use 25 different languages. By far I don't know 25 different languages. Every language I touched for the first time (written a Hello World does not count) is ***bold***. 

day01: python, I know ther could be something more efficient but my goal was to go without any libarys <br>
day02: java, ironically one of the first languages I learnd and at the moment one of the languages I dislike the most. <br>
day03: ***lua*** Interssting starting counting with 1 never seen this before <br>
day04: ***julia*** I like this language <br>
day05: php The only thing I knew in php is working with arrays :D <br>
day06: racket, used it for the first time in the first semester of my computer science studies, remeberd it more complexe <br>
day07: ***elixir***, idk regex would be nicer but got kind of confused by elixir but the pipe operator is kind of smart. never seen stuff like this (expect from the terminal) <br>
day08: ***go***, interessting, I prefere a newline between the { and the for example if statement <br>
day09: ***zig***, heard about zig as c with its problems solved. And in some aspects I agree. So definitely one of the new languages I consider using more. <br> 
day10: latex (and python), coding in latex is painful <br>
day11: ***raku***, quite interessting <br>
day12: ***OCaml***, no camel but idk I don't like languages that need to build a massive project like OCaml did, and I am not quite sure why my source file gets duplicated in _build/default/bin and even more confusing why do I find a main.exe in the same folder? I use Arch btw. <br>
day13: ***haskell***, functional programming can be kind of confusing <br>
day14: ruby, have never done a lot in ruby but somehow touched this language before but idk <br>
day15: ***perl***, felt like I should really thouch this language once <br>
day16: ***c#***, yey another exe <br>
