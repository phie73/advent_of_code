trying to use 25 different languages. By far I don't know 25 different languages. Every language I touched for the first time (written a Hello World does not count) is ***bold***. 

day01: python, I know ther could be something more efficient but my goal was to go without any libarys <br>
day02: java, ironically one of the first languages I learnd and at the moment one of the languages I dislike the most. <br>
day03: ***lua*** Interssting starting counting with 1 never seen this before <br>
day04: ***julia*** I like this language <br>
day05: php The only thing I knew in php is working with arrays :D <br>
day06: racket, used it for the first time in the first semester of my computer science studies, remeberd it more complexe <br>
day07: ***elixir***, idk regex would be nicer but got kind of confused by elixir but the pipe operator is kind of smart. never seen used stuff like this (expect from the terminal) <br>
